  description: `My name is Ali Hasnain, and I’m a dedicated and detail-oriented Senior Software Engineer with a strong passion for building scalable and efficient web applications. With hands-on experience across a variety of domains—including medical, banking, ERPs, and CRMs—I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy solving complex problems with clean, maintainable code. I'm a quick learner with a methodical, self-driven approach, and I constantly seek opportunities to grow by exploring new technologies and frameworks.

While I’ve worked across the full stack, my expertise lies in JavaScript/TypeScript, particularly with Node.js, NestJS, React.js, and Angular, and I have a deep understanding of AWS serverless architectures, Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL, and real-time systems. I enjoy turning ideas into robust backend systems and user-friendly interfaces, making meaningful contributions to both product and team growth.

I'm always open to exciting opportunities that challenge me and align with my technical skills and passion for software development.`,
